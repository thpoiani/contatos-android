# Contatos Android

> My first contact with Android development.

Just an app made for a mobile development course that make a webservice request ([koush/ion](https://github.com/koush/ion)), store data with sqlite ([realm/realm-java](https://github.com/realm/realm-java)) and show some contacts in a listAdapter.
